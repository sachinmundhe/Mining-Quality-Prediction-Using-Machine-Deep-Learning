# Mining-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Deep-Learning
In this hands on project,I have trained machine learning and deep learning models to predict the % of silica concentrate in the iron ore concentrate per miniute.
This project could be practically used in mining industry to get the % silica concentrate at much faster rate compared to traditional one.
Freepoer-McMoRan is one of the largest mining companies in the U.S. they have made use of custom-built AI models to boost the output in their mining facilities
By leveraging past 3+ years data,AI has helped the mining facility sustain a faster production pace with no loss of eficiency.Efficiency has been improved by performing operational tweaks to boost output for example(copper production could be increased if the mill was fed with more ore per miniute
